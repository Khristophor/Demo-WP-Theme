## How to use
Clone or download this project into the `wp-content/themes/` directory in WordPress. Log in to the WordPress administration area and activate the theme.

## Viewing different theme states
I've added `tags` to this codebase, so you can navigate to [releases](https://github.com/Khristophor/Demo-WP-Theme/releases) and download different versions to see how the theme behaves with different files present. If you're using version control you can `git checkout tag x.x.x` to get the different version.
